Problem 3

Define function Power with two variables; base and exponent

Begin main function
Assign integer type to variable base and initialize to zero
Assign integer type to variable exponent and initialize to zero
Print out Enter base and exponent
User enters base and exponent
Prints out the power by calling the function power
End of main function

Function Defining:
Function Power with two variable; base and exponent
Assign integer type to variable power and initialize to zero
For loop to calculate the power
If statement exponent equals one, power assigned to base
Else statement for false case when power equals base multiplied by function (base, exponent -1)
End for statement
Return power
