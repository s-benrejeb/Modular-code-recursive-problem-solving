Assignment 3
Problem 1

Define function to calculate charges per hour

Begin main function
Assign double type to variable charge and initialize to zero
Assign double type to variable hours and initialize to zero
Assign double type to totalHours 
Assign double type to totalCharge
Print out the headings for Car, Hours and Charge
For loop to display the number of cars from 1 to 3
Begin for loop
If statement to calculate the charge for the first 3 hours
Print out the charge
Else if statement to display $10 if parked for 24 hours
Else if statement to calculate the charge greater than 3 hours but less than 24 hours
Charge equals calculateCharges(hours) which calls the function
Prints out the calculated charge
totalCharges assigned to totalCharges+charge
totalHours assigned to totalHours+hours
End for loop
Print out totalHours and totalCharge
End main

Call function calculateCharges (double hours)
Calculate charge as 2.00 plus 0.5 multiplied ceil(hours)
Return charge
